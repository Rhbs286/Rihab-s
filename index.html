        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Whisk eggs, milk, water, and salt together in a large mixing bowl; add flour and butter and whisk vigorously until smooth. 
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the pan, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly. 
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Faro_de_Cabo_Espartel_%28cropped%29.jpg/1024px-Faro_de_Cabo_Espartel_%28cropped%29.jpg" alt="550" width="550">
        <p>Tangier is a vibrant port city located in the northern part of Morocco <strong class="strong">where the Mediterranean Sea meets the Atlantic Ocean. </strong>  t has a rich history, blending influences from Europe, Africa, and the Arab world. The city is known for its scenic beauty, bustling markets, and its unique cultural fusion.  <em class="em">Tangier has been an important international city  </em> ue to its location and was once a neutral zone for international powers in the 20th century.</p>
        <p> Tangier’s architecture is a blend of <strong class="strong"> traditional Moroccan styles and European influences </strong> especially visible in its old town (the medina) with narrow, winding streets, whitewashed buildings, and beautiful mosaics. On the other hand, the modern parts of the city, like the new city <em class="em"> (Ville Nouvelle), feature wide boulevards, elegant cafés, and European-style plazas. </em>Its location on the Strait of Gibraltar makes it a key gateway between Europe and Africa, both geographically and historically. </p>
        <h3>Must do activities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Explore the Medina

    Wander through the narrow, winding streets of the historic old town. You'll find local markets (souks), traditional Moroccan shops, and stunning architecture. It’s a great place to get lost and soak in the vibrant atmosphere.</li>
            <li> Visit the Kasbah

    The Kasbah is a fortified area at the top of the hill with breathtaking views over the Mediterranean and the city. You can explore the Kasbah Museum, housed in a former palace, to learn about the city’s history.</li>
            <li> Relax at the Beaches

    Tangier is home to several beautiful beaches, such as Plage de Malabata and Achakar Beach, where you can sunbathe, swim, or enjoy water sports like windsurfing and kitesurfing.</li>
            <li>Stroll Through the American Legation Museum

    The American Legation Museum is an important symbol of U.S.-Morocco relations, offering fascinating exhibits about the city’s international history and Moroccan culture. </li>

        <h3>Traditional food in Tangier</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Baysar is a traditional Moroccan dish made from fava beans, typically served with olive oil, garlic, and spices. In Tangier, it’s often enjoyed in a remilate, a type of small pot, and is perfect for a hearty breakfast or snack.
 </li>
 <li> In Tangier, a traditional and beloved breakfast or snack combo might consist of scrambled eggs with mortadella, served alongside a dollop of jben arabi, a soft, creamy goat cheese. The rich, savory flavors of the eggs and mortadella pair perfectly with the mild, tangy jben. To round off this comforting meal, a glass of Moroccan mint tea (atay) is served, its sweet and fragrant mint notes offering a refreshing contrast to the savory dishes</li>
  <li> Tangier’s proximity to the coast means that fresh seafood is a major part of the cuisine. Fish friture refers to deep-fried small fish, often served as a street food snack. It's crispy and delicious, often accompanied by a squeeze of lemon and served with bread or salad.</li>
 <li>Kalinti is a traditional Tangier snack similar to a savory pancake or flatbread, often served with a tangy salsa or sauce. The salsa is made from a mix of fresh, zesty ingredients like tangerine or lemon, and paired with a refreshing juice made from peach or local citrus fruits, it makes for a perfect meal.
